# AUV-Depth-Tracking-With-ALOS-and-ADRC
A Simulink simulation to verify depth tracking for AUV method combined with ALOS guidance law and ADRC pitch tracking control.

Method proposed and experimental verification: A hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control of underactuated AUV with experimental verification.
Plant in simulation: Verification of a six-degree of freedom simulation model for the REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle.
