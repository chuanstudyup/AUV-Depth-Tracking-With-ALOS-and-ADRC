# AUV-Depth-Tracking-With-ALOS-and-ADRC
A Simulink simulation to verify depth tracking for AUV method combined with ALOS guidance law and ADRC pitch tracking control.

Please open use Matlab2020a or newer version.

Method proposed and experimental verification: A hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control of underactuated AUV with experimental verification.

Plant in simulation: Verification of a six-degree of freedom simulation model for the REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle.
